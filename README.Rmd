# rOPTRAM

`rOPTRAM` implements the Optical Trapezoid Model to derive soil moisture
from satellite images. See @sadeghi_optical_2017



## Installation

`rOPTRAM` resides on gitlab.
You can install the development version of rOPTRAM like so:

``` r
# Install remotes package
if (! require("remote")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_gitlab("https://gitlab.com/rsl-bidr/roptram.git")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(rOPTRAM)
## basic example code
```


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
